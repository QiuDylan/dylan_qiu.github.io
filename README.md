<h1 align="center">Dylan Qiu: Mechanical Engineering Portfolio</h1>
<h2 align="left">Summary:</h2>

I am a dedicated and curious mechanical engineering student with a strong foundation in problem-solving, design, and hands-on application. My academic and project experiences reflect both technical expertise and creativity, with particular focus on mechanical systems, structural analysis, and control theory. Through coursework, independent projects, and team collaborations, I have developed a working knowledge of engineering principles while cultivating the adaptability needed to solve complex, real-world problems.

Beyond the classroom, I have gained practical experience through Formula SAE, where I contributed to the design and optimization of high-performance vehicle systems. This involvement sharpened my skills in CAD modeling, finite element analysis, and data-driven decision making, while teaching me the value of teamwork under tight deadlines. I also take pride in approaching challenges with both simplicity and precision, ensuring that my solutions are not only functional but also efficient.

This portfolio highlights a range of projects that showcase my ability to apply engineering theory to practice. Each example demonstrates my commitment to learning, innovation, and continuous improvement. My ultimate goal is to contribute to cutting-edge engineering challenges, particularly in automotive and mechanical systems, while growing as a professional in a collaborative and forward-thinking environment.
